# Best Options Right Now

## ✅ Option 1: Try Different Online Converters (Recommended)

Since you're blocked on one site, try these:

1. **Netron** - https://netron.app/
   - Upload `hey_nap.onnx`
   - Right-click model → Export → TFLite (if available)

2. **Hugging Face Spaces**
   - Go to: https://huggingface.co/spaces
   - Search: "onnx to tflite converter"
   - Use one of the community tools

3. **Google Search**
   - Search: "convert onnx to tflite online free"
   - Try the top 3-5 results

## ✅ Option 2: Use GitHub Actions (Free CI/CD)

I can create a GitHub Actions workflow that runs in a clean environment:

1. Push your ONNX file to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions runs the conversion
3. Downloads the TFLite file

Would you like me to create this?

## ✅ Option 3: Ask in Communities

- **Stack Overflow** - Post with your ONNX file
- **Reddit** - r/MachineLearning, r/tensorflow
- **Discord** - TensorFlow or ONNX communities
- Someone else might have a working environment

## ✅ Option 4: Use a Cloud VM

- **Google Colab** (try different account/session)
- **Replit** (online IDE, free tier)
- **GitHub Codespaces** (free hours)
- **AWS/GCP free tier**

## ✅ Option 5: Skip Conversion (If Possible)

Check if your ESP32 code can use ONNX directly:
- Some frameworks support ONNX Runtime for Microcontrollers
- Might be easier than converting

## 🎯 My Recommendation

**Try Hugging Face Spaces** - they have community conversion tools that might work better than generic converters.

Or **let me create a GitHub Actions workflow** - it will run in a clean Linux environment with proper dependencies.

Which would you prefer?
